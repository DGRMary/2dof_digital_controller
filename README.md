# 2dof_digital_controller
During my first year of master degree at Politecnico di Torino, I attended a course colled "Digital control technologies and architectures". The main agurment of this course was the design of a digital controller (1dof or 2 dof), using MATLAB and Simulink.
So this repository contains:
- The trace of the problem "trace.jpg"
- The MATLAB script file "quiz_03.m"
- The Simulink scheme "quiz_03_simulink.slx"
- The report "Design_report.doc"
- The two functions: "polyadd" and "dioph_mtx"
